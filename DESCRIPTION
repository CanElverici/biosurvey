Description: A collection of tools that allow users to plan systems of sampling 
    sites increasing the efficiency of biodiversity monitoring by considering the 
    relationship between environmental and geographic conditions in a region. 
    Three main modules are included: 1) Data preparation; 2) Selection of sets 
    of sites for biodiversity sampling; and, 3) Tools for testing efficiency of 
    distinct sets of sampling sites. Data are prepared in ways that avoid the need 
    for more data in posterior analyses, and allow concentrating in critical 
    methodological decisions to select sampling sites. Various algorithms for 
    selecting sampling sites are available, and options for considering 
    pre-selected sites (known to be important for biodiversity monitoring) are 
    included. Visualization is a critical component in this set of tools and most
    of the results obtained can be plotted to help to understand their implications. 
    The options for selecting sampling sites included here differ from other 
    implementations in that they consider the environmental and geographic 
    conditions of a region to suggest sampling sites that could increase the 
    efficiency of efforts dedicated to monitoring biodiversity. The methods 
    proposed here are new in the sense that they combine various criteria and 
    points previously made in related literature; some of the theoretical and 
    methodological bases considered are described in.

Motivation:

Given the increasing intensity of threats to biodiversity in the world,
one of the challenges in biodiversity conservation is to complete
inventories of existing species at distinct scales. Species
distributions depend on the relationships between accessible areas,
environmental conditions, and biotic interactions. As planning a survey
system only aims to register species in a region, biodiversity
interaction can be overlooked in this case. However, the relationship
between environmental conditions and the geographic configuration of an
area is of crucial importance when trying to identify key sites for
biodiversity surveys. Among the diverse packages in R for selecting
survey sites, such considerations are not implemented and are limited to
a random selection of sampling sites or analyses that allow detecting
potential sampling sites based on the environmental similarity between
sampled and unsampled areas. Given the need for more solutions, the
**biosurvey** package aimed for considering the relationship between
environmental and geographic conditions in a region when designing
survey systems that allow sampling of most of its biodiversity.
